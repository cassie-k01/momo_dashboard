# momo_dashboard
MoMo Dashboard is a fullstack application that takes Mobile Money (MoMo) SMS data in XML format, cleans and organizes it, then shows useful charts and tables to help understand transactions. It uses a backend pipeline to process the data and a frontend dashboard to display insights clearly. The system helps users track spending patterns, income sources, and financial trends with ease.
