 üìå Project Overview
This project is part of our Week 2 assignment for the MoMo SMS Data Processing System.  
The goal is to design and implement a robust relational database that parses raw SMS data from XML files, processes transactions, and categorizes them for further analysis.  

The database supports:  
- Secure storage of transaction and user data  
- Categorization of financial transactions  
- System logging for transparency and auditing  
- JSON data modeling for API serialization  


Database Schema

 Tables
1. Users
   - Stores unique users identified by phone numbers  
   - Attributes: user_id, phone_number, name, created_at  

2. sms_Transactions
   - Stores raw SMS messages imported from XML  
   - Attributes: sms_id, protocol, address, date_attr, type_attr, contact_name, body  

3. Transactions
   - Stores parsed transaction details linked to SMS messages  
   - Attributes: transaction_id (PK), amount, transaction_date, category, raw_body, sms_id (FK)  

4. Categorized_Transactions
   - Copy of Transactions used for analytics and category-based queries  

5. System_Logs
   - Stores logs for system activities and imports  

how to test it 
1) import databaseusing MarisDB
   **mysql -u root -p**

2) Enter password (just press enter dont enter anything cause there is no password)
   
3) run: **show tables to see tables**



4)  run:  USE momo_db;
   **then run these remaining 4 to see the tdata**
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sms_Transactions;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Transactions;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Categorized_Transactions;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM System_Logs;

# üí∏ MoMo SMS API

This is a simple REST API built in Python to manage mobile money SMS transactions.  
It reads transaction data from a JSON file and lets you view, add, update, and delete transactions using HTTP requests.

---

## üìÅ What This Project Does

- Parses SMS messages about money transfers
- Saves them as JSON data
- Builds a Python API to access and manage them
- Protects the data with login (Basic Authentication)

---

##  How to Run It

### üîß 1. Make sure you have Python installed

If you don‚Äôt have Python, download it here:  
 https://www.python.org/downloads/

###  2. Install dependencies

From the root folder of this project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
(If there‚Äôs no requirements.txt, the project uses only built-in Python libraries.)

 3. Run the server
bash
Copy code
cd api
python server.py
This will start the API at:
 http://localhost:8000

 Login Info (Authentication)
All endpoints are protected. You need to log in with:

Username: user

Password: momo123

If you try to use the API without logging in, it will say:

json
Copy code
{
  "error": "Unauthorized"
}
 API Endpoints
Method	URL	What It Does
GET	/transactions	Get all transactions
GET	/transactions/{id}	Get one transaction by ID
POST	/transactions	Add a new transaction
PUT	/transactions/{id}	Update a transaction
DELETE	/transactions/{id}	Delete a transaction

Example ID: T0001

 How to Test the API
You can use tools like curl or Postman.

 Example curl request:
bash
Copy code
curl -u user:momo123 http://localhost:8000/transactions
This gets the full list of transactions.

 Screenshots
All test screenshots are in the screenshots/ folder:

Test	Image File
GET all transactions	get_all_success.png
GET one transaction	get_single_success.png
POST new transaction	post_success.png
PUT update transaction	put_success.png
DELETE transaction	delete_success.png
Unauthorized login attempt	get_unauthorized.png
