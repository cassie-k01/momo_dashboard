Our ERD attempts to draw the data structure required by the MoMo Dashboard application. Major entities and their association are defined in order to store and process user information, SMS transaction information, categorized transactions, and system logs efficiently.

The Users table holds details about general information such as User ID, Username, Phone Number, and Email-ID. This is for the reason that users are uniquely identified by the program and associated with each transaction and activity.

Basically, the sms_Transactions table holds raw incoming SMS data, which are SMS ID, SMS message, and date received. These are the point entities for parsing transaction information and processing.

The Transactions object is a holder of parsed transaction information, like transaction ID, amount, date, category, and the SMS body in unprocessed form. It is a one-to-many with the Users object because one person may have multiple transactions. It is a one-to-one or a one-to-many with the sms_Transactions object depending on one SMS transaction being equal to one or multiple parsed transactions.
The Categorized_Transactions table also facilitates transaction categorization with the ability to hold category ID, transaction ID, and category type. This therefore allows the application to report and analyze categorized transactions.

System_Logs further records system action and events-a log ID, action, date, and its details in order to maintain a clean audit trail and aid monitoring and diagnosing the application's activities.

The general ERD design is responsible for making the MoMo Dashboard app capable of handling user data, SMS-based transaction management, transaction classification, and system detailing logging in the correct relationship and data integrity.
