ERD Design Explanation 
We chose those tables according to the MoMo SMS transaction stuff we need to save. And how 
the whole system works. First, we have the users table.This has the data on people using the 
mobile money setup. These are , sender and receiver types. We need it to keep track of who is 
who in each transaction. Then transactions table. That's the key thing here. It logs all the money 
movements, like sending money or withdrawing some. With the amount, date it was done, status, 
all that. Then we added transaction_categories. Basically to tag what the transaction was for. 
Like buying airtime, paying bills, or withdrawing cash. Makes it easy later when categorizing or 
sorting them out. Since transactions have more than one individual, sender and receiver and so 
on, we design user_transaction_role. It links users to transactions. And specifies the role, sender 
or not. Without this, both sides of storage become complex. Finally, system_logs table. Tracks 
system activities, data processing, errors occurring. Handy for debugging or verifying if 
everything went smoothly. The reason as to why we used these is to maintain organized data. 
Easy to work with. Structured for analysis in the future or inclusion of features
