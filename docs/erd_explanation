ERD Design Explanation

We chose these tables based on the MoMo SMS transaction data that we need to store and how the entire system operates.

Users Table: This table stores information about people using the mobile money system, including both senders and receivers. It helps keep track of who is involved in each transaction, ensuring that every transaction can be traced back to the correct individuals.

Transactions Table: This is the core table of the system. It logs all money movements, such as sending money, receiving funds, or withdrawals. It records important details like the transaction amount, date, status, and other relevant information.

Transaction_Categories Table: This table is used to tag transactions according to their typeâ€”such as buying airtime, paying bills, or withdrawing cash. It makes categorizing, sorting, and analyzing transactions easier and more efficient.

User_Transaction_Role Table: Since transactions involve multiple participants (e.g., sender and receiver), this table links users to transactions and specifies their role. Without this, tracking both sides of a transaction would be complex.

System_Logs Table: This table tracks system activities, data processing steps, and errors that occur during operation. It is essential for debugging, verifying processes, and ensuring the system is working smoothly.

Reasoning Behind the Design:
These tables are designed to maintain organized and structured data. The design makes it easier to work with the system, ensures traceability of transactions, and supports future analysis or reporting. By clearly separating raw data, structured transactions, user roles, categories, and logs, the system remains efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain.
